This is my calculator project!

It started off as a very simple calculator with two inputs and some operator buttons, then I decided
to try and style a calculator interface using inspiration from the dribbble website.

I used the information from the Javascript module to get the HTML elements with querySelector and get the value of the number buttons and the operator buttons that are pressed.

The hardest part was saving the first value into a variable, saving an operator value and then saving the second value to be able to calculate them all together. I read lots of articles on Javascript calculators but a lot of them used eval() or I just didnt understand them! I know my code is very long and I definitely need to rewrite it using cleaner code and more advanced Javascript. I guess its a calculator based on the Javascript that I can do right now and once my knowledge improves I will go back and update it!

At present it will take two values and calculate them together, the AC button resets the display back to 0...but if you then press another button it will display a very long number! Its a work in progress..
