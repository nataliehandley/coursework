My game is based on simple alphabet learning cards I found to help my four year old son learn his letters.

The first level has some simple pictures with the word underneath, the user has to pick the correct letter - if they do they gain a star and after 5 stars they move up to the next level. Level 2 doesn't have the word underneath so its a little harder. There are only two levels so far!

If I was going to develop it further maybe the next level they would have to choose the letter in 10 seconds.

A randomly generated image will appear each time the correct answer is clicked, if the correct answer is clicked the player will get a green screen and a thumbs up icon, if incorrect it will turn red with a thumbs down. This is so a four year can understand if the answer is right or not.

There is one bug to do with timing in that the images changes while the modal is displaying for 3 seconds, I'm not sure how to fix this yet but will keep trying!
