My game is based on simple alphabet learning cards I found to help my four year old son learn his letters.

The first level has some simple pictures with the word underneath, the user has to pick the correct letter - if they do they gain a star and after 10 stars they move up to the next level. Level 2 doesn't have the word underneath so its a little harder. There are only two levels so far!

If I was going to develop it further maybe the next level they would have to choose the letter in 10 seconds.

A randomly generated image will appear each time the correct answer is clicked
